The queue class enables instantiation with any data type by directly specifying the class name followed by the variable name, such as 'queue exampleQueue;'.
The 'linear_search()' function is designed for conducting a linear search on a vector or array. It accepts three parameters: a vector or array, a target value, and an index representing the size of the vector or array minus one since it traverses backward through the elements.
The 'insertionSort()' function, found in the linkedList class defined in queue.h is a method that can be applied to an instance of the linkedList class. This method sorts the linked list using the insertion sort technique.
